# About this repo
## Fully_Convolution_Network
This is a neural network that does road segmentation. The code was written in Google colaboratory, but you can run it locally too.
## GoogleColabSample
This contains a jupyter notebook with useful operations for Google colaboratory. 
For example, mounting google drive, installing libraries, accesing file storage or displaying information about the hardware you use in colab.
## NeuralNetworkFromScratch
Made a simple neural network that predicts numbers from mnist.It is implemented from scratch using only numpy, pandas and matplotlib. I followed the explanation from Samson Zhang (specially thanks)
It uses RelU as activation function and softmax for clasifying the results.
## self driving cars
This project uses canvas element and draws everything with JavaScript. In this project i used a neural network with genetic algorithm to learn how to drive. It starts with 100 cars, when the population is less than a procent it takes the best
car that drived the most and mutates it.
# Graph editor
This project let you draw a network of roads. This will be usefull when integrated with self driving car to create a city with autonomous drivings.
